Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.
Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

{{- if eq .Values.platform "chaimeleon" }}
When the application is ready it will be accesible via Guacamole in the following URL: 
  {{ include "chaimeleon.guacamole-url" . }}

There should be a connection created for that desktop with the following name: 
  {{ include "superset.connectionName" . }}
It can take few seconds to appear (refresh the page if you do not see it).

And remember...

    To show/hide the Guacamole menu: CTRL+SHIFT+ALT

    In the file explorer, there will be three important directories:
     - {{ include "chaimeleon.datasets.mount_point" . }}
       [All the datasets you selected to work with]

     - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_home.mount_point" . }}
       [Private persistent storage: for your algoritms, results and whatever you need for the work]

     - {{ include "chaimeleon.persistent_shared_folder.mount_point" . }}
        [Public storage where you can share files with the other CHAIMELEON users]
